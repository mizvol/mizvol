### Hi 👋

I'm an AI researcher with over 10 years of experience in industrial software engineering. My work focuses on machine learning — particularly graph neural networks — graph algorithms, information retrieval, and applied generative AI. My expertise spans software development, systems engineering, and applied AI research.
