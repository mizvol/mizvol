### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a machine learning researcher with +4 years of industrial experience. I work in the area of machine learning, data mining, analytics, and visualization. Areas of my expertise include software development, systems engineering, data science and machine learning research. I am proficient with large-scale data processing frameworks (Spark, Hadoop), graph databases (Neo4J), data visualization tools (D3, Gephi), and machine learning frameworks and libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Sklearn).

Take a look at some of my projects and tutorials on my [blog](https://blog.miz.space).
